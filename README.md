# Large Tree Monitoring (LTM)

**Large Tree Monitoring]** (LTM) is an R-based project designed to monitor large trees using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEE). The project offers tools for data acquisition, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to facilitate effective monitoring of large tree dynamics over time.

**Data Acquisition**: Utilizes GEE and rgee to access and download Sentinel-2 time series data for specified regions and time frames. As such it requires users to have a GEE account and the necessary rgee stack properly installed.

**Spectral Indices Calculation**: Computes various spectral indices to assess vegetation status, health and characteristics.

**Data Preprocessing**: Implements techniques for handling missing data, regularization/interpolation, and smoothing to prepare time series for analysis.

**Break Detection Analysis**: Detects significant changes or 'breaks' followed by decreases in vegetation greenness/amount in time series data using established R packages.

**Visualization**: Provides functions to visualize data and analysis results, aiding interpretation and decision-making.

## Dependencies

Dependencies LTM leverages several R packages, including:

-   rgee: Interfaces R with Google Earth Engine.

-   sf: Manages and analyzes spatial data.

-   terra: Handles raster data.

-   tidyverse: A collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization.

-   rgeeExtra: Extends rgee functionalities.

-   imputeTS: Imputes missing time series data.

-   bfast: Detects and characterizes abrupt changes within time series.

-   forecast: Provides methods and tools for time series forecasting.

-   lubridate: Simplifies date and time manipulation.

-   ggplot2: Creates data visualizations.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run:

``` r
install.packages(c("rgee", "sf", "terra", 
  "tidyverse", "rgeeExtra", "imputeTS", 
  "bfast", "forecast", "lubridate", "ggplot2")) 
```

## Main usage guidelines

-   **Google Earth Engine authentication**: Authenticate your GEE account using the LTM_gee_auth.R script.

-   **Data retrieval**: Use LTM_gee_data.R to specify parameters and download Sentinel-2 data.

-   **Preprocessing**: Apply LTM_pre_proc.R to clean and prepare the data.

-   **Break detection**: Execute LTM_break_detection.R to identify significant changes in the time series.

-   **Visualization**: Utilize LTM_plots.R to generate informative plots of the data and analysis results.

**Shiny Application**

LTM includes a Shiny application (LTM_shiny_app.R) that provides an interactive interface for users to visualize and analyze data without extensive coding.
